Plugin is under active development.

Plugin for [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar).

[The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### How to use plugin
 - [Install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#)
 - Drop pomodoro.1m.rb file into your BitBar plugins folder
 - Make sure it's executable (in Terminal, do chmod +x moex.1m.rb)

### Underlying principles
There are six stages in the technique:

 1. Decide on the task to be done.
 2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
 3. Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.
 4. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
 5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 1.
 6. Else (i.e. after four pomodoros) take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

A goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible. When interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity must be recorded and postponed (inform – negotiate – schedule – call back) or the pomodoro must be abandoned.
